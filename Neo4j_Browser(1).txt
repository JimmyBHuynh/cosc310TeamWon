Neo4j Browser is a command driven client, like a web-based shell environment. It is perfect for running ad-hoc 
graph queries, with just enough ability to prototype a Neo4j-based application.

    Developer focused, for writing and running graph queries with Cypher
    Exportable tabular results of any query result
    Graph visualization of query results containing nodes and relationships
    Convenient exploration of Neo4j's REST API


    Single line editing for brief queries or commands
    Switch to multi-line editing with <shift-enter>
    Run a query with <ctrl-enter>
    History is kept for easily retrieving previous commands



A result frame is created for each command execution, added to the top of the stream to create a scrollable 
collection in reverse chronological order.

    Special frames like data visualization
    Expand a frame to full screen
    Remove a specific frame from the stream
    Clear the stream with the:clear command



The sidebar expands to reveal different functional panels for common queries and information.

    Database metadata and basic information
    Saved scripts organized into folders
    Information links for docs and reference

Neo4j is like a mashup of a REPL (read-eval-print loop) + lightweight IDE (integrated development environment) 
+ graph visualization.
