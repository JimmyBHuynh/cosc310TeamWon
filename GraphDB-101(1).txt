A graph database can store any kind of data using a few simple concepts:

    Nodes - graph data records
    Relationships - connect nodes
    Properties - named data values

The simplest graph has just a single node with some named values called Properties. 

    Nodes are the name for data records in a graph
    Data is stored as Properties
    Properties are simple name/value pairs


Nodes can be grouped together by applying a Label to each member. 

    A node can have zero or more labels
    Labels do not have any properties


Like any database, storing data in Neo4j can be as simple as adding more records. 

    Similar nodes can have different properties
    Properties can be strings, numbers, or booleans
    Neo4j can store billions of nodes


The real power of Neo4j is in connected data. To associate any two nodes, add a Relationship which describes how the records are related.

    Relationships always have direction
    Relationships always have a type
    Relationships form patterns of data

In a property graph, relationships are data records that can also contain properties.
